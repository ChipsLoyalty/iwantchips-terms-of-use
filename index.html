<h2 id="section9">9. GETTING STARTED.</h2>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Accessing the App.</strong> We make our App available free of charge through third-party application stores, such as the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. To download our App from the third-party app stores, you will need to set up an account the app store. We have no responsibility for the app stores and assume no responsibility for their collection, use, processing, storing or sharing of data. Please refer to the data privacy statements and terms of use of these providers to understand how they may collect, use, process, store and share your data.</p>
<p class="indented">The App can also be accessed via the web on a computer or mobile device with a web browser by visiting IOU Corp.com and setting up and account there.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Register for a User Account.</strong> You must register for a User Account to use the App. During registration, we will collect your name, phone number, and email address. You will be asked to select a username and password.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Account Types.</strong></p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Manufacturer Account.</strong> To offer goods for sale, or redemption, through the App, you must submit an application to and become approved by IOU Corp. The application process is free of charge. The application seeks basic information about you, your company and your products. If approved as a distributor, you will be required to provide additional business information (EIN, etc.). Once your distributor account is established, we will provide you with the capability to request QR codes that can be used through the App and by app users.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Vendor Account.</strong> To allow for consumers to redeem promotions, users at retail locations will be required to acquire a distributor account. This will allow access to the web portal that will translate QR codes into coupon codes that should be used in the distributors POS (point-of-sales) system when presented with QR codes by consumers using the App.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Consumer Account.</strong> To arrange to claim points through the App, you will need to set up a consumer account. This account will also allow users to redeem points for coupons and promotions that can be used at retail locations for discounts or giveaways at participating distributor locations.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Service Fee.</strong> Depending on your type of registration, we may charge a service fee for use of the App on a subscription basis. This fee is payable on a monthly basis unless otherwise agreed between you and IOU Corp in writing.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>License to Access the App.</strong> Subject to these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, IOU Corp grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the functionality, features, content and information provided through the App to conduct business transactions and earn rewards. You may not use the App or the Services for any other purpose or in any other manner without first obtaining written permission from IOU Corp.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Proprietary Rights.</strong> You may not use the contents of the App in any manner or for any purpose that would constitute infringement of IOU Corp’, its licensors’, or any other person’s or entity’s intellectual property rights. IOU Corp and/or its licensors own all copyrights, patents, trademarks and service marks relating to or appearing on the App. The unauthorized use or misuse of these trademarks and service marks is prohibited.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Updates.</strong> Sometimes we may update the App and/or Services to support additional devices, provide enhanced functionality and/or to improve performance, user experience and security.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Use of Personal Data.</strong> You acknowledge and agree to IOU Corp’ collection and use of your personal information as part of providing the App and Services as set forth in IOU Corp’ Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="indented"><strong>Account Termination.</strong> If you do not use the App for more than 60 days, we may deem your account to be terminated. We also reserve the right to alter or terminate accounts and/or our App and App functionality at any time and in our sole discretion.</p>

<h2 id="section10">10. CONDUCTING TRANSACTIONS.</h2>
<p>The App is designed to facilitate and track transactions only. IOU Corp is not involved in the actual sale of product or collection of payment. The sale and payment are done between users of the App directly (as purchasers and distributors). Once you arrange for a transaction, you will complete the transaction separately and without the involvement of IOU Corp. However, once a product is purchased, the distributor will provide the purchaser with a QR code, which the purchaser may scan in the App to track and earn reward points.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="section11">11. REWARDS.</h2>
<p>Upon completing a transaction facilitated through the App, purchasers may scan the QR code provided by the distributor within the App to accrue points (referred to as “chips” inside of the App). Any points consumers accrue will then be stored in a digital wallet within the App. Consumer users may spend points after they’ve accrued them by then producing redemption barcodes from within the App that can be presented at a participating distributor’s location in exchange for rewards. You agree to abide by all applicable laws and these Terms of Use when earning and redeeming awards. IOU Corp’ records will be deemed the official records for rewards. If you believe there is an error in your rewards, please contact us at [hello@chips-loyalty.com]. IOU Corp will review any claimed errors within thirty (30) days. IOU Corp’ determination with regard to rewards will be final and made in IOU Corp’ sole discretion. IOU Corp cannot guarantee points will accrue to your account if IOU Corp cannot track the applicable QR codes accurately. IOU Corp will do its best to track and allow for redemption of points, however, technical problems and human error can and do occur that prevent us from verifying or adding points. While we try to prevent errors from occurring, we do not guarantee 100% accuracy and cannot be held liable for any such errors.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p class="indented">We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the rewards program and wallet at any time, in our sole discretion. If we modify our program, we will post updates within the App or otherwise provide notification regarding such changes.</p>
<p class="indented">There is no equivalent monetary value to points accrued, so if you terminate your account or we modify or terminate your account or our rewards program, your points will be forfeited.</p>

<h2 id="section12">12. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS.</h2>
<p>The content, layout and functionality of the App are owned by IOU Corp and its licensors, and are protected by U.S. copyright and trademark laws.</p>
